# 🛍️ AI Retail Decision Copilot

An AI-powered business analytics assistant that helps retail businesses make smarter decisions — built with LangGraph, FAISS, pandas, and Streamlit.

Upload your sales CSV and business documents. Ask questions in plain English. Get answers like a business analyst.

## 💡 What Problem Does This Solve?

Retail businesses have two kinds of data:
- **Structured data** — sales CSVs, inventory sheets, customer records
- **Unstructured data** — annual reports, strategy PDFs, market research

Most tools handle one or the other. This copilot handles both simultaneously, routes your question to the right engine automatically, and gives you a single, cited answer.

## ✨ What It Can Do

**Ask analytics questions about your CSV:**
- "Which product category drives the most profit?"
- "Show me the revenue trend over the last 3 months"
- "What are the anomalies in my sales data?"
- "Which products are underperforming?"

**Ask document questions about your PDF:**
- "What does the annual report say about Q3 performance?"
- "What risks were identified in the market research?"
- "Summarise the key recommendations from this report"

**Ask hybrid questions — it handles both:**
- "Why did electronics sales drop, and what does the strategy doc say about it?"

## 🏗️ How It Works

The core of this project is a **LangGraph conditional workflow** — not a simple chatbot chain. Every question gets classified first, then routed to the right processing path.

```
User Question
↓
IntentRouter — classifies: analytics / rag / both
↓                          ↓
AnalyticsNode              RAGNode
(runs pandas on CSV)  OR  (searches FAISS index)
↓                          ↓
Synthesiser
(writes business analyst answer with citations)
↓
Final Answer
```

The intent router uses the LLM to classify each question — so "which product sold most?" goes to the analytics engine, "what does the report say?" goes to FAISS retrieval, and questions that need both run both paths and synthesise the output.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why I chose it |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| UI | Streamlit | Full app in Python, no frontend framework needed |
| Agent orchestration | LangGraph | Conditional routing between nodes — not possible with a simple chain |
| LLM | Llama 3.1 8B (via Groq) / Gemini | Flexible model choices, default to Groq (Llama 3.1 8B) |
| Vector database | FAISS (local) | Zero infrastructure, runs in memory, sufficient for single-user |
| Data processing | pandas | Industry standard, handles messy retail CSVs well |
| Charts | Plotly Express | Interactive charts in 2–3 lines, native Streamlit support |
| Embeddings | sentence-transformers (BGE-small) | Free, local, runs in memory on CPU with any LLM |

USE_GROQ=true
USE_GEMINI=false
```

Or use **Gemini** (alternative):

## 🕵️ Mini-Extension: Smart Column Detective

In retail analytics, user queries are conversational (e.g., *"Which category drives the most profit?"* or *"Show me the trend of sales"*). In real-world data, column names are messy and vary across source files (e.g., `product_category`, `units_sold`, `profit_margin`).

The **Smart Column Detective** mini-extension dynamically maps conversational question terms to the actual column names in the uploaded dataset:
1. **Rule-Based Mapping (Fast Path):** Matches query keywords against exact column names and known retail domain synonyms (e.g., mapping "sales" to `revenue` or `sales_amount`).
2. **LLM-Based Mapping (Semantic Path):** If heuristics are ambiguous, it queries the LLM with the dataset profile to resolve the target numeric, categorical, and date columns.
3. **Graceful Fallbacks:** Validates selections against the verified schema, falling back to default columns if matches fail.

It logs and displays mapped column metadata in the UI, keeping the data query flow highly visible and robust.

## 🧠 Key Things I Learned Building This

**LangGraph routing is not if/else** — the conditional edge works by returning a string key from a separate function, not by branching inside a node. I initially tried to put routing logic inside the IntentRouter node itself, which broke the graph. The right pattern is: node sets `state.route`, then a separate edge function reads it.

**Pydantic v2 breaking change** — `state.dict()` is deprecated. Every node was throwing `PydanticDeprecatedSince20` warnings on every call. The fix is `state.model_dump()` everywhere. Small change, but it was cluttering logs on every single query.

**DataFrames don't belong in LangGraph state** — putting a pandas DataFrame directly into the Pydantic state adds serialization overhead and causes issues. Better pattern: store the DataFrame in `st.session_state`, pass only the text summary (the `data_summary_text` string) through the LangGraph state.

**`has_csv` was always False** — I had `has_csv = bool(state.kpi_summary)` in the intent router, but `kpi_summary` is never populated in the graph. So the router was always telling the LLM "no CSV uploaded" even when one was. Fixed it to read from `st.session_state.get("clean_df") is not None`.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations (V1)

- Single file at a time — one CSV + one PDF
- In-memory only — data resets on page refresh
- No authentication — single user
- Answers are based on data summary, not raw rows (by design — for privacy and token efficiency)
