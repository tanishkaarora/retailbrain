> **An AI-powered decision support platform that combines Business Analytics, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to help retail businesses make intelligent, data-driven decisions.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Retail businesses generate large volumes of structured data (sales, inventory, customer records) and unstructured data (reports, manuals, market research). Extracting meaningful insights from this information often requires multiple tools and technical expertise.

**AI Retail Decision Copilot** simplifies this process by combining business analytics, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), machine learning, and AI-powered conversational interfaces into a single intelligent platform.

Users can upload retail datasets and business documents, ask natural language questions, explore dashboards, retrieve information from documents, and receive actionable business recommendations.

This project is being developed as the foundation for a larger enterprise AI platform that will continue evolving throughout my third year.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* **Analyze Retail Data:** Ingest and profile retail sales, inventory, and customer datasets.
* **Dynamic Conversational QA:** Answer business questions using natural language.
* **Context-Driven Routing:** Dynamically route queries to structured analytics, unstructured RAG, or both using LangGraph.
* **Document Intelligence:** Parse and retrieve information from uploaded business reports (PDF) using RAG and local FAISS vector search.
* **Intelligent Recommendations:** Synthesize statistical insights and policy text into logical business recommendations with proper source citation.
* **Visual Dashboards:** Generate interactive Plotly charts corresponding to natural language analytics queries.

This project will continue to evolve into a production-grade enterprise platform throughout my third year:

* **SaaS Split Architecture:** Separate frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (FastAPI, Redis) execution spaces.
* **Persistent Knowledge DB:** Transition from local FAISS to a cloud-based pgvector/PostgreSQL setup.
* **Machine Learning Analytics:** Train and integrate ML models (XGBoost/Prophet) for future inventory and sales forecasting.
* **Collaborative AI Agent Framework:** Build specialized sub-agents coordinating autonomously to write briefs or replenish stocks.
* **Enterprise Security:** Support multi-tenant OAuth2 user login and dataset permission rules.
