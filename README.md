## 📖 Project Overview
**RetailBrain** is an AI-powered business decision copilot designed for retail operators and managers. It merges structured financial sales datasets and unstructured business strategy/report documents into a single, unified conversational interface. 

Instead of jumping between spreadsheet pivot tables and dense strategy PDFs, retail managers can ask natural language questions and receive mathematically precise analytics, contextual text citations, and auto-generated data visualizations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
In modern retail management, decision-makers are constantly inundated with two disjointed data streams:
1. **Structured Data**: Raw spreadsheets detailing transaction logs, profit metrics, and inventory categories.
2. **Unstructured Data**: Strategic guidelines, PDF market research reports, supplier contracts, and regional performance reviews.

Traditional business intelligence (BI) dashboards only handle structured charts, while general-purpose document chat tools cannot perform mathematical computations over spreadsheets. Handoffs between these databases lead to high operational overhead, analysis latency, and hallucinated calculations by LLMs. **RetailBrain** solves this gap by uniting analytical computing and semantic RAG retrieval under a single, non-linear state manager.

---

```

### Complete Control Flow:
1. **User Submission**: The user uploads a CSV/PDF in the Streamlit Sidebar.
2. **Intent Classification**: The query is routed to the `IntentRouterNode` inside LangGraph. The node queries the LLM to classify the query as `analytics`, `rag`, `both`, or `general`.
3. **Execution Routing**:
   * **Analytics Pathway**: If the route is `analytics` or `both`, the `AnalyticsNode` executes, pulling the dataset from the session state to perform statistical analysis.
   * **RAG Pathway**: If the route is `rag` or `both`, the `RAGNode` runs, querying the local FAISS vector store for semantic matches.
4. **Synthesis Node**: The outputs are aggregated in the `CopilotState`. The `SynthesiserNode` invokes the LLM to combine numbers, strategy context, and source pages into a formatted business brief.
5. **Chart Generation**: If analytics were computed, the Streamlit frontend triggers the `ChartGenerator` to dynamically display matching Plotly Express charts.

---

## 🧠 Why LangGraph?
Traditional LLM frameworks use linear, sequential chains (`Prompt -> LLM -> Output`). However, real-world business copilots require conditional, branching, and cyclic logic:
* **Conditional Logic**: A user asking about sales data should not trigger the document indexer. LangGraph evaluates query intent at run-time and opens only the necessary paths.
* **State Preservation**: The `CopilotState` acts as a single source of truth across all nodes, preventing context loss during multi-stage routing.
* **Complex Merging**: For queries requiring both structured calculations and strategic recommendations, LangGraph runs paths in parallel and joins them cleanly in the synthesizer.

---

## 💡 Why Hybrid Analytics?
LLMs are notoriously bad at math. Asking a language model to directly compute sums, averages, or percentage growth rates over millions of rows of data inevitably leads to **hallucinations**. 

**RetailBrain** uses a hybrid approach:
1. **Precise Computations**: Raw numbers, trend tables, and statistical anomalies are computed programmatically using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
2. **LLM Contextualization**: The precise outputs (tables and summaries) are fed into the LLM as textual context.
3. **Outcome**: The LLM writes the narrative explanation, while the numbers remain 100% mathematically correct.

## 📝 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
We document critical engineering choices using ADRs. The full records are located under `/docs/adr/`:
- 📄 **[ADR-001: LangGraph Adoption](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/ai%20copilot/docs/adr/ADR-001.md)** — Decision to use LangGraph StateGraphs instead of linear chains for state control.
- 📄 **[ADR-002: In-Memory FAISS Indexing](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/ai%20copilot/docs/adr/ADR-002.md)** — Choice of a local, zero-infra FAISS database for session-based vector retrieval.
- 📄 **[ADR-003: Streamlit UI Framework](file:///c:/Users/HP/OneDrive/Desktop/ai%20copilot/docs/adr/ADR-003.md)** — Decision to host a rapid-prototype UI inside Streamlit for accelerated evaluation.

---

## 🕵️ Mini-Extension: Smart Column Detective
The **Smart Column Detective** resolves gaps between human conversational terms and actual spreadsheet columns:
1. **Rule-Based Mapping**: Analyzes column headers for regex synonyms (e.g. mapping "Sales", "Earnings", or "Revenue" to `total_sales`).
2. **LLM-Based Mapping**: If rules fail, the detective sends the schema profile to the LLM to identify categoricals, timestamps, and metric fields.
3. **UI Transparency**: Displays mapping confidence and mapping choices directly in the sidebar, preventing calculation crashes on non-standard CSV headers.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned (Weekly Reflections)

### Week 1: Foundation
* Setting up a clean file architecture is critical before starting any agent development.
* Keeping LLM prompt templates decoupled from function logic under `src/prompts/` avoids code clutter.

### Week 2: Core Routing
* LangGraph state modifications must happen via explicit returned state updates from nodes, not by changing thread variables.
* Metaclass wrappers are required in Streamlit to manage environment configurations safely without cross-session pollution.

### Week 3: Testing & Polish
* Streamlit caching is dependent on hashable objects. Passing raw Pandas DataFrames breaks `@st.cache_data`. Passing file byte arrays instead resolves cache serialization.
* Standard `print()` outputs are buffered inside Streamlit containers; debugging outputs must be sent to `sys.stderr` to bypass buffer latency and display immediately in the cloud panel.

### Week 4: Deployment
* Containerized Streamlit deployment dashboards require strict secrets binding in TOML format to prevent credentials leaks.
* Wrapping third-party imports in try-except blocks ensures robustness against cloud resolver bugs.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
* **Single-File Scope**: The application supports exactly one CSV and one PDF upload per user session.
* **Ephemeral In-Memory DB**: The vector database and uploaded files live in-memory and reset on web page refreshes.
* **No Authentication**: The interface is an open dashboard; no login or multi-tenant workspaces are implemented in this build.
* **Token Budget Summary**: Large tables are summarized into schemas and statistical profiles before being sent to the LLM to avoid context window overflow.

## 🗺️ 3rd Year Roadmap

RetailBrain will continue evolving into a production-ready AI Business Intelligence platform.

- **Version 1.1:** Multi-file support, persistent vector database (ChromaDB/Qdrant), and enhanced dashboards.
- **Version 1.2:** Conversational memory, authentication, natural language to SQL, and sales forecasting.
- **Version 2.0:** Multi-agent architecture, FastAPI + React, Docker, CI/CD, cloud deployment, and support for multiple business domains.

**Long-Term Vision:** Build an enterprise-grade AI Business Intelligence platform that combines analytics, RAG, and AI agents to deliver intelligent, data-driven business insights.

---

## ⚡ Performance
* **Encoder**: BGE-small embedding model runs locally on CPU, generating 384-dimension vectors in less than 50ms.
* **Vector Store**: FAISS similarity search takes less than 10ms for a 100-page document block.
* **LLM Output Latency**: Groq Llama 3.1 8B produces streaming output speeds exceeding 250 tokens per second.

---

## 🔒 Security
* **Zero Keys Committed**: No API keys are hardcoded. Local configurations read from `.env` (which is excluded via `.gitignore`).
* **Production Secrets**: Streamlit Cloud deployments read API keys from secured environment secrets.
* **Data Privacy**: Local vector databases and pandas operations are run in memory and are never sent to external vector clouds.
