# 🛍️ AI Retail Decision Copilot

> **An AI-powered decision support platform that combines Business Analytics, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Machine Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to help retail businesses make intelligent, data-driven decisions.**

---



# 📌 Project Overview

Retail businesses generate large volumes of structured data (sales, inventory, customer records) and unstructured data (reports, manuals, market research). Extracting meaningful insights from this information often requires multiple tools and technical expertise.

**AI Retail Decision Copilot** is designed to simplify this process by combining business analytics, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), machine learning, and AI-powered conversational interfaces into a single intelligent platform.

Users will be able to upload retail datasets and business documents, ask natural language questions, explore dashboards, retrieve information from documents, and receive actionable business recommendations.

This project is being developed as the foundation for a larger enterprise AI platform that will continue evolving throughout my third year.

# 🎯 Project Objectives

* Analyze retail sales, inventory, and customer datasets
* Generate business KPIs and interactive dashboards
* Answer business questions using natural language
* Retrieve information from uploaded documents using RAG
* Generate intelligent business recommendations
* Build a scalable architecture for future AI agents and enterprise deployment
